# Deep-Clustering

In this series, deep clustering techniques are studied. A briefe overview of these methods is given and the steps towards generating clusters are explained.

The first series aims at investigating the quality of cluster initialisation in presence of adequate data preprocessing steps. Also, different types and archtuctures of the neural network are built and tested to see how the quality of cluster initilasation is affected by these choices.
